The goal is to create a simple tasks & projects API. While making it work is the minimum requirement, you will also be judged on how you think in terms of use cases, edge cases, error handling, etc., and also on code structure, quality and consistency. Write your est/cleanest code, and donâ€™t forget comments for every function, and a ReadMe file.",
